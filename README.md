A Learning Curve.
An old newbie playing with an iPad trying to catch up with his grandchildren.
For the record :-
Over the years I have dabbled with creating my own Web Page. My main attempt was using Virgin Medias free web space. I worked with a desk top computer running Windows. The site is completely hand coded using ‘notepad’ as a text editor for HTML code. The site was last updated in 2007 and the final rendition can be found here :- http://homepage.ntlworld.com/g.steeper/index.htm
Now at the age of 86 in the year of our lord 2014 I have turned my attention to an Apple iPad and intend to restrict my computing hobby to what I can get out of this fascinating little machine. I have been using the iPad for around 18 months having bought it for my wife for her 82nd. birthday. She is now the proud owner of the model with a retina display. Letting me use her ‘old’ iPad to pursue my retirement hobby.
